*Read Data into R*

```{r}
Animal<-read.csv("~/UTexasDA/BikeData/AnimalData.csv")
View(Animal)

#first few
head(Animal)

#Summary of the Data
  
```{r AnimalData}
summary(AnimalData)
```


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
